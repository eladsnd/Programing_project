# Programing_project
a project done building k-means algorithem using python and C 
this project was made in the C programing language and phython and connected by CAPI
in the project we have the Kmeans Algorithem and Spectral Clastring algorithem 

the algorithem will recive dimentions of data
it will create test data using Make_blobs
it will calculate the clusters using both methods
it will visualise the data 
and it will output the data , clusters and will show the accuracy using jaccard method
